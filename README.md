# Websupport OpenAPI

This specification has been manually created using available [documentation],
but it's possible that there are errors or missing new features as the API
evolves over time. I'm making an effort to keep it up to date.

I would greatly appreciate any contributions or updates to the OpenAPI file to
address any issues.
