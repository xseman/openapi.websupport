# Websupport OpenAPI

![Alt text](docs/swagger-ui.png)

This specification has been manually created using available [documentation],
but it's possible that there are errors or missing new features as the API
evolves over time. I'm making an effort to keep it up to date.

[documentation]: https://rest.websupport.sk/docs/index

I would greatly appreciate any contributions or updates to the OpenAPI file to
address any issues.

# Auth

See [documentation][auth-documentation] with examples.
